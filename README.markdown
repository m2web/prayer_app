Prayer App

This is a port of my PrayerWeb app that I have created in .Net 2.0 back in 2005 to Rails 3. 

I am using this to better learn Rails 3.

TODOS: 
-Update the reading link in the prayer_pages/home view to reflect the current month via an instance variable from the helper.
-Research about the parsing of an XML file for the display of a daily Westminster catechism Q and A in the prayer_pages/home view.
