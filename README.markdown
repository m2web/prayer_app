Prayer App

This is a port of my PrayerWeb app that I have created in .Net 2.0 back in 2005 to Rails 3. 

I am using this to better learn Rails 3 one step at a time and really enjoying it! And using Codeship.io.

TODOS:
-Continue rolling my own authentication as I continue to learn via Hartl's Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial.
