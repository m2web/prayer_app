Prayer App

This is a port of my PrayerWeb app that I have created in .Net 2.0 back in 2005 to Rails 3. 

I am using this to better learn Rails 3 one step at a time and really enjoying it!

TODOS:
-Research about the parsing of an XML file for the display of a daily Westminster catechism Q and A in the prayer_pages/home view.
-change the instance variables in prayer_pages_controller to local variables and in today.html.erb remove the instance variable references when testing complete.
